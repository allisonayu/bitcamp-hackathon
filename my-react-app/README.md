Welcome to Buttercup Corner!

The purpose of our website is to design and output a user-created avatar, which is food-themed. The user can choose a body, mouth, and eyes, and then the website will output the desired character. The website is grocery-store themed, so the characters' bodies are based on certain food items (such as a fried egg, a blueberry, etc.). 

Our project implements React, specifically Vite React. The frontend is coded in Typescript, CSS and HTML.
