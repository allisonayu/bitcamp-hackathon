## Project Description
Our website, Buttercup Corner, enables users to design and output a food-themed avatar. Our project is grocery-store themed, so the characters' bodies are based on certain food items (e.g., fried egg, blueberry, etc). The user can choose any combination of bodies, mouths, and eyes, and the website will output the desired character.


## Tools, Libraries, & Languages
Our project implements React, specifically Vite React. The frontend is programmed in TypeScript, CSS, and HTML. The avatar characteristics, logo, and home page were drawn on Procreate.
