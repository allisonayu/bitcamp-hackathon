# Welcome to Buttercup Corner!


## Project Description
Our website's purpose is to design and output a user-created food-themed avatar. The user can choose a body, mouth, and eyes, and the website will output the desired character. The website is grocery-store themed, so the characters' bodies are based on certain food items (such as a fried egg, a blueberry, etc.). 


## Libraries & Languages
Our project implements React, specifically Vite React. The frontend is programmed in Typescript, CSS and HTML.
